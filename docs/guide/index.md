# Introduction

`create-polyglot` is a CLI that scaffolds a polyglot microservice monorepo including:

- Node.js (Express)
- Python (FastAPI)
- Go (net/http)
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Next.js frontend

It produces a workspace with `apps/*` services, optional Turborepo or Nx presets, and a basic dev runner when no preset is chosen.
